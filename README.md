## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
 
### What I learned
 I learnt when to use grid abit more, expectially grid template columns and grid template rows.
 Using developers tool to analyse web page is also one of the major knowledge i gain during this challenge.
   

```css
main{
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
    grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 1fr);
}
.container{
    height: fit-content;
}  
```

### Continued development

The height of the svg image used as the background for the first content.
